# SafeLearnVirus

SafeLearnVirus is a conceptual educational project created solely for learning and research purposes. It is not designed, intended, or suitable for any form of malicious use or deployment.

This project serves as an exploration into programming and system behavior. It simulates certain virus-like actions, strictly within a controlled and educational environment. The code demonstrates various Windows API functions and file system manipulations, focusing on concepts rather than actual harmful actions.

## Purpose:

### Educational Intent: The project aims to illustrate programming techniques and system interactions without causing any harm.
### Research and Learning: It provides insights into Windows API, file system operations, and controlled system behavior.
## Note:

This project does not contain any harmful payloads, and it is crucially emphasized that it should not be used for any real-world applications. It is intended for educational and informational purposes only.
